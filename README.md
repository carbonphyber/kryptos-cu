Cuda C++ implementation of [Kryptos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) decryptor.

Depends on [Nvidia Thrust library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/thrust/) for [Nvidia Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
Both require Nvidia GPU device.

Once Thrust has been installed, these example programs can be compiled
directly with nvcc. See [Makefile](./Makefile) for build command with `nvcc`.
